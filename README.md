# üîñ üìê üí´ *MathJax Bookmarklet*

*MathJax Bookmarklet* is a [üîñ bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) for rendering üìê TeX/LaTeX and MathML notation on pages dynamically üí´ using the [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) library.

Pages don't have to include `mathjax.js`.
The library is included and configured dynamically. The LaTeX preprocessor will render equations delimited by `$...$` or by `\(...\)` (for inline maths) and `\[...\]` or `$$...$$` for display math.

The ASCIIMathML preprocessor will render equations delimited by ``` `...` ```.

*Note: This bookmarklet will also try to render math notation inside iframes. This will be successfully executed only on iframes on the same domain because cross-domain policies don't support modification of iframe content from other domains*.

## Install
Install the bookmarklet **[HERE](https://naereen.github.io/mathjax-bookmarklet/)**.

## [Known bug](https://github.com/Naereen/mathjax-bookmarklet/issues)
- [#1](https://github.com/Naereen/mathjax-bookmarklet/issues/1) fails if a page failed to load MathJax (for instance a HTTPS page using an incorrect HTTP link to load MathJax). I don't know AT ALL how to tackle this, any idea is [welcome](https://github.com/Naereen/mathjax-bookmarklet/pulls).

## Build?
Minify the bookmarklet from bookmarklet.js by using `uglifyjs bookmarklet.js -m`. (with UglifyJS2)
